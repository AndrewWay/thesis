\section{Ground State Degeneracy}
In this chapter results of simulations on the dipolar kagome lattice are presented. EFM simulations reveal zero-temperature states lacking domain walls that consist of 3 spins and their negatives. Every ground state obtained through the EFM simulation exhibits a three-sublattice structure with one spin and its negative for each sublattice. The spins alternate in direction along the [1,1,1] direction.

Every ground state configuration obtained through the EFM simulation is characterized by the following set of equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_a}
\alpha = \sin{\theta} \cos{\phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_b}
\beta = \sin{\theta} \sin{\phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_c}
\chi = \cos{\theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_d}
\delta = (2a^2-1)/2c
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_e}
\epsilon = \sqrt(1-a^2-d^2)
\end{equation}

This set of equations acts as elementary building blocks for the components of the spin vectors that exist in the dipolar kagome ground state. The spin vectors may be constructed with this set of equations using the following configuration.

$$\overrightarrow{a} = (\alpha, \beta, \chi)$$
$$\overrightarrow{b} = (\delta, \epsilon, -\alpha)$$
$$\overrightarrow{c} = (-\epsilon, -\chi-\delta, \beta)$$
$$\overrightarrow{d} =-\overrightarrow(a)$$
$$\overrightarrow{e} =-\overrightarrow(b)$$
$$\overrightarrow{f} =-\overrightarrow(c)$$


The set of all possible ground states is therefore characterizable in terms of two parameters: theta and phi. Any theta and phi gives rise to an acceptable ground state of the same energy for a particular lattice size, with the exception of a subset of angles that results in imaginary values for the spin components or undefined division by zero.

\end{figure}


Any theta and phi will give rise to a valid ground state of the same energy with the exception of those pairs of theta and phi that lie within the bound region of the graph. Within the bound region of the graph, e = √(1–a²–d²) ∈ ℂ. At each node of each bound area, d = (2a²–1)/2c → ±0/0. Therefore, any choice of theta and phi outside of this region will give rise to a valid ground state of the same energy.

It is possible to reduce the size of this graph to 1/16 the size by showing that a state in each portion of the graph is relatable to an analogous state in the other portions of the graph via symmetry operations.

\subsection{Visualization of the Ground State}

By generating the spin vectors described by the !!!equations!!!, spin configurations ranging from planar to non-planar states can be obtained. The following contour plot illustrates the volume of a parallelopiped formed by a spin configuration corresponding to a particular $\theta$ and $\phi$ on the plane of the plot. It is from this illustration that one can obtain an understanding of what choices of $\theta$ and $\phi$ result in planar states or non-planar states.

The following plots illustrate some of the possible spin configurations that result from particular choices of $\theta$ and $\phi$.

\subsection{Planar Ground States}

The thin strip of blue that cuts into the contour plot just above the complex region consists of the set of points that give rise to parallelopipeds with the smallest volume. This corresponds to spin configurations that are planar. Elsewhere in the plane, the spin configurations are non-planar. The strip of points that give rise to planar states are described by the following polar equations:

\begin{equation}
\phi = \frac{\pi}{4}\cos{\gamma} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}(\sin{\gamma}+2)
\end{equation}

The spin configurations that are planar can therefore be described in terms of one parameter, $\gamma$, the polar equations which determine $\theta$ and $\phi$, and the original set of equations.
