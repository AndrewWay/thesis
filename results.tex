\section{Ground State Degeneracy}
In this chapter results of simulations on the dipolar kagome lattice are presented. EFM simulations reveal a many-fold degenerate ground state allowing zero-temperature states comprising a six-sublattice structure; three of the sublattices contain spins that are the negatives of the spins on the remaining three sublattices. The spins alternate in direction along the [1,1,1] direction.

\end{figure}

\clearpage
Every ground state configuration obtained through the EFM simulation is characterized by the following set of equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_a}
\alpha = \sin{\theta} \cos{\phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_b}
\beta = \sin{\theta} \sin{\phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_c}
\chi = \cos{\theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_d}
\delta = (2a^2-1)/2c
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rel_e}
\epsilon = \sqrt(1-a^2-d^2)
\end{equation}

This set of equations acts as elementary building blocks for the components of the spin vectors that exist in the dipolar kagome ground state. There are two parameters that dictate the resulting ground state: $\theta$ and $\phi$, which are polar angles of the spin "A". Spin A is arbitrarily chosen. The spin vectors themselves may be constructed as follows:

$$\overrightarrow{a} = (\alpha, \beta, \chi)$$
$$\overrightarrow{b} = (\delta, \epsilon, -\alpha)$$
$$\overrightarrow{c} = (-\epsilon, -\chi-\delta, \beta)$$
$$\overrightarrow{d} =-\overrightarrow{a}$$
$$\overrightarrow{e} =-\overrightarrow{b}$$
$$\overrightarrow{f} =-\overrightarrow{c}$$

\end{figure}


Any theta and phi pair chosen from the plane in figure \ref{fig:degenplanefull} will give rise to a valid ground state of the same energy with the exception of those pairs of theta and phi that lie within the bound region of the graph. Within the bound region of the graph, e = √(1–a²–d²) ∈ ℂ. At each node of each bound area, d = (2a²–1)/2c → ±0/0.

It is possible to reduce the size of this graph to 1/16 the size by showing that a state in each portion of the graph is relatable to an analogous state in the other portions of the graph via symmetry operations.

\subsection{Visualization of the Ground State}

By generating the spin vectors described by equations \ref{eqn:rel_a},\ref{eqn:rel_b},\ref{eqn:rel_c},\ref{eqn:rel_d}, and \ref{eqn:rel_e}, spin configurations ranging from planar to non-planar states can be obtained. An example of a non-planar state is shown in figure \ref{fig:sampgs}.

	\caption{The six sublattice spins conjoined at their ends for clarity and illustration. The vector denoting <1,1,1> axis of symmetry is illustrated in black}
	\label{fig:sampgs}
\end{figure}

To gain insight into what choices of $\theta$ and $\phi$ pairs give rise to particular states, consider the contour plot in fig. \ref{fig:gsvol}. The contour plot illustrates the volume of a parallelopiped formed by the a, b, and c spin vectors corresponding to a particular $\theta$ and $\phi$ chosen from fig. \ref{fig:degenplane}. It is from this illustration that one can obtain an understanding of what choices of $\theta$ and $\phi$ result in planar states or non-planar states.

As an example, the point corresponding to a planar state located at the point $\theta$=2.3108 and $\phi$=0.27 was chosen, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:volplane_ex}.

Using equations \eqref{eqn:rel_a},\eqref{eqn:rel_b},\eqref{eqn:rel_c},\eqref{eqn:rel_d}, and \eqref{eqn:rel_e}, the vectors were conjoined as shown in fig. \ref{fig:volplaneex_vecs}.

\subsection{Planar Ground States}

The thin strip of blue that cuts into the contour plot just above the complex region consists of the set of points that give rise to parallelopipeds with the smallest volume. This corresponds to spin configurations that are planar. Elsewhere in the plane, the spin configurations are non-planar. The strip of points that give rise to planar states are described by the following polar equations:

\begin{equation}
\phi = \frac{\pi}{4}\cos{\gamma} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}(\sin{\gamma}+2)
\end{equation}

The spin configurations that are planar can therefore be described in terms of one parameter, $\gamma$, the polar equations which determine $\theta$ and $\phi$, and the original set of equations.

\section{3D Dipolar Kagome Finite T EFM Results}


\section{3D Dipolar Kagome Magnetic Field EFM Results}

In this section results on the application of an external magnetic field on the dipolar kagome lattice are presented. EFM simulations revealed how a sufficiently large external magnetic field caused the spin configuration to transition from a non-planar state to a planar state. Following this transition, the spins underwent a linear change in orientation with respect to the magnetic field magnitude by reorienting in the direction of the magnetic field. Following degaussing, the spins unaligned with the magnetic field and formed a planar state at zero magnetic field magnitude, regardless of whether the state was initially non-planar. In essence, when degaussing with a sufficiently high peak magnetic field magnitude, every minimum-energy state was transformed into a planar minimum-energy state. Finally, with sufficiently high magnetic field magnitude, the lattice became saturated and the rate at which the spins reoriented themselves along the direction of the magnetic field was reduced. 

\subsection{Magnetic Phases}

The magnetization as a function of magnetic field magnitude of the 3D kagome lattice had several distinct phases of change. In figure \ref{fig:magphase}, the magnetization lingered close to zero at low magnetic field magnitude. At some critical magnetic field magnitude, a sudden change in magnetization occured for all non-planar states after which a planar state was formed. A linear change in magnetization was observed after this critical field magnitude, until the lattice became saturated and the magnetization nearly plateaued.

Using the state corresponding to theta=0.206275 and phi=3.11867, the effect of an magnetic field along the 001 cube axis was observed. The spin configuration begin to transition to a planar configuration at a magnetic field magniutde of 0.0105 and achieved the planar state at a magnetic field magnitude of 0.0121 as shown in fig. \ref{fig:001vecs}.
The pink and brown spins swap positions, as do the blue and purple spins, as the field is increased beyond the planar state. The spins gradually align with the 001 field direction, until approximately at 0.14 the lattice becomes saturated and the red and green and spins become parallel to the field direction.

\paragraph
\large
Once the lattice was saturated, the magnetic field was reduced to zero. The lattice left the saturated state at a field lower than what was required to induce it while increasing the field. The transition from saturation occured at approximately H=0.13, compared to the transition to saturation at H=0.14 when the field was decreased. 
The spins gradually unaligned and rested in a planar state at zero field, and was characterized by the groundstate angles theta=1.569051 and phi=0.78435097.

Using the state corresponding to theta=0.206275 and phi=3.11867, the effect of a magnetic field along the 011 cube face was observed. The lattice began to transition at an approximate magnetic field magnitude of 0.007. At a magnitude of 0.0074 the planar state was achieved. At 0.0093, the 
pink and red spins swapped position, and the blue and green spins swapped position as shown in \ref{fig:011vecs}. As the field was increased further to a magnitude of 0.0115,
the green and brown spins began to swap positions. At 0.143, this interchanging of spin positions was achieved. Once saturated, no spins was parallel
with the field direction.%Description here

\subsection{Saturation of the Lattice}
Using the spin configuration corresponding to theta=0.206275 and phi=3.11867, 7 simulations were run with differing field directions. The field was increased up until saturating the lattice. 001 and 010 both have identical magnetization curves, as do 011 and 101. However, 100 differs from 001 and 010, and 110 differs from 011 and 101, which is unexpected. When using the 111 field direction, saturation occurs at a field that is higher than the saturation fields of any other simulations.

\subsection{Reduction of the Ground State Degeneracy via Application of an External Magnetic Field}

The most notable result of degaussing the 3D FCC Kagome lattice with only dipolar interactions is that all possible ground states can be transformed into planar states. 26 different ground states were generated as shown in fig \ref{fig:groundstatearray}. Each of these states were degaussed with a field along the 111 direction.

The result of these simulations is summarized in fig. \ref{fig:postdegaussedarray}. 24 of the initial states rested in the final state corresponding to theta=1.9486 and phi=0.697303, while only 2 rested in the final state corresponding to theta=1.58175 and phi=0.778825.
