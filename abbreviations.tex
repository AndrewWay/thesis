If you don't have a list of abbreviations, then you don't need to include this file and you can comment out the corresponding lines in your main .tex file.  For example, if this file just defined a couple of terms such as AFM, then you wouldn't necessarily need this.

If you do have abbreviations to define, then you will probably set them up in a table like this:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  $E$ & energy\\
  $\vec{E}$ & electric field\\
  EFMS & Erika\\
\end{tabular}
