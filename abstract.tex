Results are presented on analytic and computational analyses of the spin states associated with ABC stacked
kagome planes of magnetic ions with only long-range dipole-dipole interactions. Extending previous work on
the 2D kagome system, where six-fold discrete degeneracy of the ground state was revealed [1], we show that
the 3D FCC kagome lattice exhibits a continuous degeneracy characterized by just six sub-lattice spin vectors
and two spherical angles. Thermal fluctuations are shown to lift this degeneracy in an order-by-disorder
process. Degaussing the lattice with a magnetic field applied along directions of high symmetry also results
in lifting the continuous degeneracy to a subset of states from the original set of ground states, characterized by a single parameter. This lattice type is a model for the magnetic Mn ions in IrMn3, the most popular compound used as the antiferromagnetic pinning layer in hard-drive spin valve structures [2]. Analysis of these spin states is relevant for a deeper understanding of magnetic and thermal stability at surfaces and in thin films of IrMn3.
